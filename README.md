# Personal-Banking-System
This project is a simple class-based banking system written in Python. It allows users to manage their personal transactions efficiently. The system includes the following features:

Add Transaction: Users can add new transactions with details like title, amount, type (Expense or Deposit), and an optional note.

Remove Transaction: Users can remove transactions by specifying the title.

Display All Transactions: Users can view a summary of all transactions stored in their wallet.

Search Transactions: Users can search for specific transactions by title or type.

Save Transactions: Users can save their transactions to a JSON file.

Load Transactions: Users can load transactions from a JSON file.

The project demonstrates the use of Python classes, file handling, JSON serialization, and basic error handling to create a functional personal banking system.
